  "6734bc5220237ccb9096e6a1 startedMessageText": "You need storage space, and I've got just the thing. But it's not free. Pay up in Bitcoins, and you get a container. Simple as that.\n\nNo need to waste my time if you're not ready to deal.",
  "6734bc5220237ccb9096e6a1 successMessageText": "Pleasure doing business with you. Here's your container.\n\nTry not to fill it with junk. Or do, not my problem. Just don't come crying if you run out of space again.",

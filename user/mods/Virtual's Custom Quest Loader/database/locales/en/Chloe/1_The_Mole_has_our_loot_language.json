Of course, he had a shipment of serious value on him when he went missing. We need to find out what happened and recover our loot.\n\nMark his last known location and, for once, don't leave any tracks. Do it right or don't do it at all.",
  "6734916945defbd81ec2f677 startedMessageText": "The Mole's probably dead. I don't care how it happened, but I do care about the loot he had. Go find where he was last seen, mark the spot, and do it quietly. We're not running a charity for sloppy work.",
  "6734916945defbd81ec2f677 successMessageText": "Surprise, surprise, the Mole's dead. Guess I shouldn't be shocked.\n\nAt least we got some of the loot, though I'm still pissed about losing a supplier. You did your job, so I'll give you that.",

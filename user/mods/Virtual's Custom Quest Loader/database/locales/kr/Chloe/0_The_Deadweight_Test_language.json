Newsflash: if you don't know how to scavenge, you're as good as dead.\n\nThink you can handle finding basic shit like shampoo, soap, and toilet paper? If you can't grab the essentials, don't even bother crawling back here. I don't have time for dead weight.\n\nProve you're not completely useless and bring me that stuff. Then maybe I'll throw you something worthwhile.",
